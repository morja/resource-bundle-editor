Please also make sure not to make changes to existing code that are not really necessary or asked for.
Also, please remove code that you have prevously created but that is not necessary anymore.
And when going to make a bigger changed like removing functionality or changing an underlying tool, plese first ask.
Always try to use the most simple approach and in a way that it can later be easily understood and maintained.
Avoid repetitive code and use abstraction and patterns where appropriate.
